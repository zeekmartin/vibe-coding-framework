# Example 00 — Bootstrapping a New Project with AI

Goal: start a new project using the Vibe Coding Framework in a controlled way.

## Steps

1. Create a new repository using the template.
2. Open the repository in your editor or IDE.
3. Ask your AI or AI agent:

> “Based on this repository structure, help me fill:
> - docs/architecture.md
> - docs/security.md
> - docs/non-regression.md
>  
> Ask clarifying questions if needed. Keep everything concise.”

4. Review and adjust the generated content.
5. Commit the initial documentation.

## First iteration

- Pick `prompts/feature.prompt.md`
- Define a very small feature
- Execute the prompt
- Update `todo.md`

## Key takeaway

The framework allows you to start fast **without skipping thinking**.
