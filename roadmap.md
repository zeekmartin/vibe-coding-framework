# Roadmap — Vibe Coding Framework

This roadmap reflects the current intentions for the framework.
The goal is to keep it **lightweight, practical, and tool-agnostic**.

Dates are indicative and may evolve based on feedback.

---

## v1.0 — Initial public release ✅

- Stable repository structure (`docs`, `prompts`, `examples`)
- Core documentation:
  - Architecture
  - Security
  - Non-regression
  - Graphic charter
  - Intra-application conventions
- Reusable prompt templates
- Iteration anchor (`todo.md`)
- Examples illustrating real workflows
- MIT license

---

## v1.1 — Clarity & adoption (short-term)

Focus: make the framework easier to adopt and reuse.

- Improve prompt clarity based on early feedback
- Add one or two additional real-world examples
- Minor documentation refinements (no breaking changes)
- README improvements based on community questions

---

## v1.2 — Optional automation (medium-term)

Focus: assist users without enforcing tooling.

- Optional CI examples (lint / formatting / checks)
- Optional pre-commit hooks (non-mandatory)
- Optional scripts for security and non-regression checks
- Clear separation between **core framework** and **optional helpers**

---

## v2.0 — Extensions, not expansion (long-term)

Focus: extend without bloating.

- Advanced prompt patterns (large refactors, migrations)
- Multi-repo / mono-repo adaptation guidelines
- Examples for larger teams
- Case studies from real projects

---

## Explicit non-goals

To keep the framework sustainable, the following are intentionally out of scope:

- Mandatory tools or languages
- Heavy CI/CD pipelines
- Opinionated tech stacks
- AI model–specific logic
- Complex configuration layers

---

## Guiding principle

Stability > novelty  
Clarity > cleverness  
Structure enables speed

Feedback, issues, and contributions are welcome.
