# Prompt: Refactor (Safe)

## Goal
Refactor code to improve maintainability/performance **without changing behavior**.

## Inputs
- Target module(s)/file(s):
- Refactor intent (readability, performance, structure):
- Constraints / invariants:
- Current pain points:

## Instructions
1. Describe the intended refactor and why it is safe.
2. Make changes in small, reviewable steps.
3. Preserve public interfaces and behavior.
4. Include a regression checklist.
5. Summarize changes and update notes for `todo.md`.

## Guardrails
- No functional changes unless explicitly requested.
- No silent breaking changes.
