# Prompt: Feature Implementation

## Goal
Implement a new feature with minimal surface area and no regressions.

## Inputs (fill these)
- Feature description:
- User story / acceptance criteria:
- Affected areas (files/routes/components):
- Constraints (must not change):
- Performance considerations:
- Rollout plan (feature flag? gradual?):

## Instructions
1. Propose a short plan (3–7 steps).
2. Identify risks and dependencies.
3. Implement the change **without altering existing behavior** outside the scope.
4. Provide code changes as a patch-style response.
5. Provide a minimal test plan (unit + manual checks).
6. Update notes for `todo.md` (what changed, risks, next).

## Non-negotiables
- No secrets in code
- No new endpoints without auth considerations
- Prefer additive changes
