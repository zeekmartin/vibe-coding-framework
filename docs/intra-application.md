# Intra-application Sharing

When you have multiple apps/services (e.g., marketing site + app + docs), align on:

## Shared conventions
- URL patterns
- Locale handling
- Auth/session boundaries
- Error handling and logging format

## Shared artifacts
- Brand assets (logo, colors)
- UI components (if applicable)
- Common copy snippets (privacy, legal, pricing terms)

## Cross-app links
- Rules for linking between getmytwin.io / app / docs
- UTM conventions (optional)
- Default language fallback behavior

## Deployment coordination
- Version compatibility notes
- Rollback considerations across apps
